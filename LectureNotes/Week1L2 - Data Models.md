# Module 2: Data Models

---

## 2.1 Chapter Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
- Explain **data modeling** and why models are important
- List building blocks of data models
- Define **business rules** and their impact on design
- Outline major data models and their evolution
- Identify new data models and their purpose
- Classify data models by their abstraction level

---

## 2.2 Data Modeling and Data Models

- **Data modeling**: The process of designing a model that represents the data in a problem domain.
  - Is *iterative*—models are refined step by step.
- **Data model**: A simple, conceptual representation of real-world objects and relationships.
  - Helps database designers capture complexity and reduce errors.

- **Section Summary**
  - Data modeling creates conceptual representations of real-world objects and their associations, providing a roadmap for effective database design and reducing complexity and errors.
- **Real-world Case Study**
  - When designing a customer relationship management (CRM) system for a retail company, data modeling helps identify critical entities such as customers, orders, and products. This ensures that relationships between purchases and customer profiles are clearly defined, allowing accurate tracking and personalized communication.

**Prompt:**  
Imagine designing a database for an online bookstore. What information (entities, relationships) would you start modeling?

---

## 2.3 Importance of Data Models

- Data models help people **communicate**:
  - Programmers, managers, and users often see data differently.
- Creating a solid blueprint before making the database ensures it works for everyone.
- *Without a good model, database design is likely to fail.*

**Example:**  
The finance manager and developer may each view customer data differently—data models create a common language.

### Section Summary
Data models bridge communication gaps among stakeholders, provide blueprints before implementation, and reduce design risks by capturing perspectives and expectations ahead of development.

### Real-world Case Study
At a hospital, administrators, doctors, and IT technicians have different points of view regarding patient data. A well-designed data model accommodates medical histories, appointment records, and lab results, ensuring everyone’s requirements are met for smooth, error-free care delivery.

---

## 2.4 Basic Building Blocks

- **Entity**: Object of interest (person, place, thing, event).
- **Attribute**: Characteristic of an entity.
- **Relationship**: Association among entities.
- **Constraint**: Rule or restriction on data.

**Types of Relationships:**
- **One-to-many (1:M):** One customer can have many orders.
- **Many-to-many (M:N):** Students register for many classes; classes have many students.
- **One-to-one (1:1):** One person, one passport.

---

### Section Summary
Entities, attributes, relationships, and constraints are the foundational components that structure data and govern how it is stored, linked, and validated.

### Real-world Case Study
A university enrollment system treats "Student," "Course," and "Enrollment" as entities. Relationships (students enrolling in courses) and constraints (students cannot enroll in courses with time conflicts) maintain both structure and integrity.

---

**Prompt:**  
List entities and their relationships for a college registration system.

---

## 2.5 Constraints

- Constraints ensure **data integrity**.
- Expressed as rules (e.g., “GPA must be between 0.00 and 4.00”).

**Example:**  
Each classroom must have only one teacher, an employee’s salary must be within defined limits.

---
### Section Summary
Constraints safeguard data integrity by imposing rules that validate data entries and relationships, preventing inappropriate or inconsistent data storage.

### Real-world Case Study

In a payroll database, constraints ensure that no employee is assigned a salary below the government minimum wage. If an entry doesn’t meet the criteria, the system rejects it—helping the company comply with regulations and avoid errors.

---

## 2.6 Knowledge Check

**Q:** What is a relationship? Name its three types.  
**A:** An association among entities. Types: one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many.

---

## 2.7 Business Rules

- **Business rule:** A clear policy, procedure, or principle specific to an organization.
- Define entities, attributes, relationships, and constraints.
- Should be concise, unambiguous, and widely understood.

**Examples:**
- “A customer may generate many invoices.”
- “An invoice is generated by only one customer.”

---

## 2.8 Discovering Business Rules

- Gathered from managers, policy documents, and company procedures.
- Crucial for standardizing how data is viewed and used.

**Prompt:**  
Interview a department manager—what business rules define how they manage data?

---

## 2.9 Translating Business Rules to Models

- Example:  
  Rule: “A customer may generate many invoices”—identifies Customer and Invoice entities and a one-to-many relationship.

---

## 2.7–2.9 Business Rules & Translating to Models
### Section Summary
Business rules reflect organizational policies, shaping entities, relationships, and constraints in the data model—directly impacting how information is structured, stored, and processed.

### Real-world Case Study

A gym’s membership system uses business rules such as “A member may book many classes, but a class can only be booked by members with active subscriptions.” These rules clarify relationships in the model and automate eligibility checks.

---

## 2.10 Naming Conventions

- Use clear, descriptive names for entities and attributes.
- Prefix attributes with entity names for clarity (e.g., CUS_CREDIT_LIMIT).
- Good conventions make models easier to read and maintain.
  
---
### Section Summary
Consistent naming conventions improve clarity, maintenance, and teamwork in database projects, ensuring components are easily understood and referenced.

### Real-world Case Study
An airline reservation system uses prefixes such as FLT_ (flight), CNF_ (confirmation) to label attributes (e.g., FLT_NUMBER), making the database easier to navigate for developers and analysts.

---

## 2.11 The Evolution of Data Models

- Changing views over time shaped how databases work:
  - **Hierarchical Model:** Data organized like an upside-down tree (parent-child).
  - **Network Model:** More flexible and complex relationships.
  - **Relational Model:** Data viewed as tables (relations).
  - **Entity Relationship Model (ERM):** Graphical diagrams for entities & relationships.
  - **Object-Oriented Model:** Data and behavior combined as objects.

---

## 2.12 Relational Model

- Based on **relations**—two-dimensional tables (rows = tuples, columns = attributes).
- Uses powerful RDBMS software to manage tables.
- SQL provides access and manipulation.

* Any SQL-based relational database application involves the following three parts:
     - **User Interface (UI)**
    The UI enables users to interact with the database via graphical apps, command-line tools, or APIs to query and manage data.
    
     - **Database Tables**
    Data is stored in structured, relational tables with rows and columns, designed for easy access and manipulation.   
    
     - **SQL Engine**
    The SQL engine processes queries, executes operations (e.g., retrieve, insert, update, delete), and ensures data integrity.

Figure 2.2  A Relational Diagram



**Prompt:**  
Compare tables in Excel to database tables. How are they similar, and how are they different?

---

## 2.13 Entity Relationship Model (ERM)

* Conceptual Simplicity
  * Complex database design requires clear, simple concepts to achieve successful outcomes.

* Graphical Tools for Design
  * Database designers use graphical tools to visually represent entities and their relationships.

* **Entity Relationship Model (ERM)**
  * The ERM provides a framework for modeling database entities and relationships.
  * Foundation of Relational Design
  * The ERM and relational data model together form the basis for structured database design.

* Visual tool: **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD).**
  * An ERD uses graphical symbols to represent database components, entities, and their relationships.
  * Common notations: **Chen, Crow’s Foot, UML(the Unified Modeling Language) class diagrams**.
  * Shows entities (boxes), attributes, and relationships.

<br>


**Activity:**  
Draw an ERD for a simple library database (books, authors, borrowers).

---

## 2.14 Object-Oriented and Extended Models

- **Object-Oriented Data Model (OODM):** Data as objects, with attributes and methods.
- **Class:** A set of similar objects; supports inheritance.
- **O/R DBMS:** Combines relational and object features.
- **XML:** Standard for storing and exchanging structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.

## 2.11–2.14 Data Model Evolution and Modern Models
### Section Summary
Data models have evolved from hierarchical and network systems to the relational and object-oriented paradigms. Recent innovations enable scalability, flexibility, and support specialized needs like graph structures for social networks and time series for IoT data.

### Real-world Case Study
 
A bank uses relational databases for transaction records but leverages graph databases to detect fraudulent patterns in money transfers by mapping relationships. For IoT-enabled ATMs, it adopts time series models to monitor machine health data in real time.
